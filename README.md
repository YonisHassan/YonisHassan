## Projects and Research

### Modelling Electrostatic Penetration Energy
A dissertation project exploring the computational modelling of electrostatic penetration energy in molecular systems, focusing on accurately representing non-classical charge distribution effects.

### Predicting Car Acceptability Using Categorical Features
Developed and optimised Random Forest and Multi-layer Perceptron models using the UCI Car Evaluation dataset. Achieved up to 98.8% accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and class balancing with SMOTE.

### Pulsar Star Classification from Signal Data
Created a decision tree classifier to identify pulsars from radio signal data in the HTRU2 dataset, achieving 96.7% accuracy using stratified k-fold cross-validation and ROC analysis.

### Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions
Engineered a machine learning pipeline to detect financial fraud, achieving a 95% precision rate. Emphasised interpretability, class imbalance handling, and practical deployment.

### Scientific Paper Topic Modelling
Applied NLP methods including LDA and BERTopic to identify and visualise research trends in scientific publications. Emphasised unsupervised learning and insight generation.

### UK Crime Data Analysis
Analysed UK crime datasets using data science techniques, producing interactive visualisations and spatial-temporal insights to support urban planning and public policy.

### AI-Powered Personal Study Planner
Developed a machine learning solution generating personalised study schedules based on user availability, subjects, and learning preferences.

### Emotion Detection from Speech and Text
Implemented multimodal emotion recognition combining machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyse audio and textual data.

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Differential Equations
Leveraged deep learning models incorporating physical laws (PINNs) to solve differential equations relevant in physics and engineering.

### Fourier Transform Visualiser
Created an interactive educational tool demonstrating Fourier transforms and frequency decomposition principles for signal analysis.

### Marginalia – A Platform for Self-Expression
Developed a minimalist, ad-free Django platform for essays, poetry, and personal thought, prioritising authenticity and artistic freedom.

### Bespoke Search Engine
Constructed an experimental front-end search interface emphasising visual design, interactivity, and customised query suggestions.

### Rust Unit Converter
Built a command-line unit converter application in Rust, emphasising robustness, clarity, and type safety.

### Portfolio Website
Designed and developed a personal portfolio website consolidating projects, writings, and research outputs into a unified digital presence.
